## Fusing Rules & Notes

* **All Identical Required [Yes]**: Gear must be identical and at the required tier level to fuse.
    * *Example*: Winding Key: Power (Green) + Winding Key: Power (Green) gears to be fused.

* **Quick Fuse**: It is safe to use this option as it will fuse all gears up to **Purple** and stop.

* **NOTE**: Once gear is tiered to purple, all gear will be the same by slot.
    * *Example*: Different boots will all become the same purple boot when tiered to purple.

## Resource Management

* **Level Down**: 100% resources returned.

* **Downgrade**: 100% resources returned with gear exceptions\*. Tier Level Gear returned. Tier Level Fodder gear returned as component gear.
    1.  Original gear used as fodder will **not** be returned.
    2.  Fodder gear will be converted to component gear used as fusing material only.
    3.  Downgrade will **not** break down gear back to the previous tier.
    * *Example*: Gold 3 will return Gold gear and 3 Gold component gears. No purple gears will be returned.
